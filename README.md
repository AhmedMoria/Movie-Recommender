# 🌿 Plant Disease Classification 🌱🔬

A deep learning-based **Plant Disease Classification** system built using **TensorFlow** and **Streamlit**. This model helps farmers and agricultural experts quickly diagnose diseases in plant leaves by analyzing images. 🍃📸

## 🚀 Features
✅ Classifies diseases for **Potato, Tomato, and Pepper** plants  
✅ Uses a **pretrained deep learning model** for accurate predictions  
✅ Simple **web interface** built with **Streamlit**  
✅ Displays **disease confidence scores** and highlights infected areas  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **TensorFlow** - Deep Learning Model  
- **Streamlit** - Web UI  
- **NumPy, OpenCV, PIL** - Image Processing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** - Data Visualization  

## 📸 How It Works
1. **Upload** a clear image of a plant leaf 🍃  
2. The model **analyzes** the image and classifies the disease  
3. Get an **instant diagnosis** with a confidence score  
4. Take preventive measures based on the result ✅
